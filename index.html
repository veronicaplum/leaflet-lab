        <p>This movement forever changed modern Chinese culture and booming tourism industry. Thousands of expats live in China today and there definately a micro-culture surrounding that spatiality. In gerenal the industry is shifting today. Previously, the terracotta warriors in Xi'an and the Great Wall near Beijing were popular places and still are. Except in recent years, the visitor toll on the Great Wall has been lower in comparison, where more tourists appear to prefer methods of ecotourism. Yet this freedom comes at a price, while many foreigners experience troubles with the Chinese government surrounding nitpicky things, such as having an approved place of residence every night during their stay in china. In short, no matter where a forieigner chooses to stay, they have to registered and documented there. </p>
